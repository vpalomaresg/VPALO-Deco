# VPALO's GNU/Linux Customizations

`Note 1`: If something is missing or wrong, feel free to check the [KDE Plasma Documentation](https://develop.kde.org/docs/plasma/) yourself.

`Note 2`: âœ… **`VPALO-Deco`** (*Plasma Window Decoration*) is based on [`vinceliuice`](https://github.com/vinceliuice/MacSonoma-kde)'s work.

## Plasma Window Decoration
1. Move the `VPALO-Deco` folder to `/usr/share/aurorae/themes/` directory.
2. Once you moved the directory, go open  `Window Decorations` to apply `VPALO-Deco` (*Plasma Window Decoration*).

## Color Scheme
1. Move the `VPALO.colors` file to `/usr/share/color-schemes` directory.
2. Once you moved the file, go open `Colors` to apply `VPALO` (*Color Scheme*).
